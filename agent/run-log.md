# Run Log

## 2026-06-24

Completed:

- Added deploy output files, agent operating files, project docs, feedback files, route export work, launcher cleanup, subtle motion, paper page styling, and supporting content docs.

Next:

- Run `prompts/004-ar-route-check.md`.

Notes:

- The repo uses `agent/` as the active operating folder.
- Build and device QA were not run in this environment.

## 2026-06-25

Completed:

- Implemented State Intelligence Sync, Autonomous Bounded Turn, scheduled turn policy, and supporting state ledgers.
- Applied the print-first tabletop UI/navigation pass.
- Split `/print` from `/book`, then collapsed all public non-AR paths back into the booklet reader surface.
- Added cached Three.js paper background with precomputed albedo, normal, and depth maps.
- Removed the prior stripe-style background treatment.
- Pinned `nexusrealtime` in `package.json` to main commit `ebd19e298d71bfbc51bf452394085ce1d909cb94`.
- Added local service-kit scaffolding under `src/kits/`.
- Added local domain services under `src/domains/`.
- Added `src/data/bookletPanels.js` and `scripts/check-print-composition.mjs`.
- Reworked the public non-AR surface into a one-page comic booklet reader with title/opening beat, page controls, and panel reveal state.
- Added a flat glossy flipbook treatment with sharp page edges.
- Added cover-turn-first behavior and vertical deck/page flip motion.
- Wired launcher and print surfaces through a NexusRealtime `createRealtimeGame()` instance with local runtime kits and `engine.n.*` services.
- Updated the deploy workflow to use `npm install` while this dependency migration is pending lockfile regeneration.

Validation:

- Open PR search returned no open PRs before these source batches.
- Source files were inspected after update through the GitHub connector.
- Added `npm run check:composition` into the build path.
- Build and browser preview were not run from this connector environment.
- `package-lock.json` was not regenerated in this environment.

Post-change audit:

- Improved: root, launcher, print, and book routes now resolve to the same booklet reader path.
- Improved: title/opening state and panel reveal controls are driven by local services.
- Improved: route, paper surface, booklet reader, and panel sequence behavior now have local kit/service boundaries.
- Improved: flipbook motion is CSS transform/opacity based for performance.
- Still needs review: browser build, deployed route behavior, readability, animation timing, and lower-end fallback.
- Still needs follow-up: regenerate and commit `package-lock.json` in an environment with network access.

Next:

- Run `npm install`, `npm run check:composition`, `npm run build`, and browser checks.
- Regenerate and commit `package-lock.json` for the pinned NexusRealtime main commit.
- Validate root, launcher, print, book, one AR route, and one debug route.
